## üîç Overview
Watchdxg is a Python-based scraper that manage one's X account to ensure it keeps a good reputation in regards to X standards.
The script logs in to an X account and evaluates the legitimacy of each account that interacts with your content.

According to some criteria, if an account is found to be a bot account that's meant to bomb your reputation, it'll be signaled and blocked by watchdxg to preserve your X account's reputation.

The goal of this project is to mitigate if not cancel the effects of discreditation campaigns that uses low-rep accounts to bomb some X accounts's reputation.
